Weekly Progress
===============

Software Engineering is both art and science.  The scientific part of Software
Engineering requires data, so let's get some...

Each week, we will take a snapshot of the data in Project Statistics
and record it here.

This information can be used to measure things like:
- The ratio of documentation to code (what's the right balance)
- The programmers' efficiency in terms of lines of code per week
- The average number of commits per lines of code changed
- How the number of test points is related to working lines of code
