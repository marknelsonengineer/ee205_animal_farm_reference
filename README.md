Animal Farm is a series of labs intended to teach the basics of C and C++.  It's also intended to introduce good
Software Engineering practices.  Students are expected to "Live" in
this project as the code evolves over a series of requirements.

| Animal Farm 0       | An array-based database of cats, where each attribute is an array.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Animal Farm 1       | An array-based database of cats, where each a cat's attributes are collected in a `struct`.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Animal Farm 2       | A procedural singly linked-list database of cats, where each cat is an object.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Animal Farm 3       | A collection class that implements a singly linked database of Animal objects using: <ul><li>An abstract List</li><li>A concrete SinglyLinkedList</li><li>generic Node</li></ul>Add an abstract Animal (which also inherits from Node) & Mammal to the Cat object model. |
| Animal Farm 4       | A collection class that implements a doubly linked list of Mammals.  <br/>Build some class factories.  <br/>Add Dog to the object model w/ a class factory.  <br/>Add destructors to the object model.                                                                   |
| Animal Farm 5       | Refactor the collection class into a Binary Search Tree.  <br/>Add Birds and Fish to the object model.                                                                                                                                                                   |
