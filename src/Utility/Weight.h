/// Every Animal has a Weight in the world.
///
/// C++ maintains Weight as a `float` (#t_weight), however, weights in the physical world
/// have certain constraints (i.e. you can't have a negative #weight -- and/or you
/// *may* have a maximum weight.)
///
/// By default, the weight is #UNKNOWN_WEIGHT (-1).  Once it's known, it can never
/// be un-known.
///
/// If the Weight has a maximum weight, then #weight must be `<=` it.  Also,
/// the #weight can never be `<= 0`.  #maxWeight is set in a constructor
/// and can not be changed.
///
/// Weight can can be expressed in different units of measure (#UnitOfWeight).
/// The Weight's unit of measure is set in a constructor and can not be changed.  It
/// defaults to #POUND.  Other units of measure are the #KILO and #SLUG.
///
/// We are not implementing a complete numeric class, which would have
/// overrides for:  `*=  /=  %=  ++  --  +  -  *  /  >=  >  <=  !=` and `<=>`
